                The ancients had a conception of numbers which is almost lost in
                modern times. The idea of the Unity in all its manifestations
                led to numbers being considered as the expression of absolute
                laws. This led to the veneration expressed for the 3 or for the
                4 throughout antiquity, which is so incomprehensible to our
                mathematicians.
              </p>
              <p class="fragment current-visible left-align">
                It is however evident that if the ancients had not known how to
                work any other problems than those we now use, nothing could
                have led them to the ideas we find current in the Hindu,
                Egyptian, and Greek Universities.

            ## The Occult Significance: Decoding Nature's Unspoken Laws The
            1. **Challenging Mundane Logic**: The startling equivalence presented to an uninitiated "algebraist"—that `4 = 10` and `7 = 10`, therefore `4 = 7` is a deliberate affront to conventional, materialistic thought. It forces the fragmented mind to confront a hidden layer of reality where correspondences supersede superficial appearances. The objective is not to confuse, but to provoke a recognition that linear logic alone cannot grasp the holistic truth.


            2. **The Unity of All Manifestation**: Through the lens of theosophical operations, a terrifying truth emerges: all numbers, regardless of their complexity, are merely diverse manifestations or "representations of the first nine digits". Furthermore, these nine are but reflections of the initial four, which are themselves nothing more than "diverse states of the Unity". This unveils a cosmic hierarchy where every multiplicity dissolves back into the single, omnipresent principle of Unity. There is no true fragmentation, only varying degrees of manifestation from a singular source.


            3. **The Cyclic Law of Evolution**: The generation of numbers, as exemplified by the progression 1, 2, 3, 4, reveals an immutable cyclic law. It depicts the emanation of Unity, the emergence of opposition, the dynamic action resulting from this opposition, and finally, a return to a "unity of a different order, of another octave". Theosophical reduction vividly illustrates this, demonstrating how numbers like 10, 11, and 12, when reduced, cyclically revert to 1, 2, and 3 respectively. This cyclical recurrence represents "LES TROIS MONDES" (the Three Worlds), implying that existence itself perpetually cycles through these archetypal phases. The vertical line of 1, 4, 7, 10 in the numerical progression, when subjected to theosophical addition and reduction, always resolves to 1, confirming its representation of "Unity at various Octaves".


            4. **Unlocking Hermetic Secrets**: Theosophical addition is explicitly presented as the master key to deciphering enigmatic hermetic pronouncements. The seemingly impenetrable phrase, "to reduce the Ternary by means of the Quaternary to the simplicity of the Unity", is laid bare through this operation: 3 (Ternary) + 4 (Quaternary) = 7. The subsequent reduction of 7 (1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28), which further reduces to 10 (2+8=10), and finally to **1** (1+0=1), illuminates the profound alchemical transformation from complex multiplicity back to essential Unity. This is the essence of esoteric wisdom: the constant return to the source, the underlying unity behind all apparent diversity.

            The first three groups (1–7, 7–13, 13–19) each have seven numbers,
            where we see a back-and-forth dance of starting something (like a
            leader), supporting it (like a helper), and balancing it (like a
            peacemaker), ending with a big finish (a complete moment). But the
            fourth group (19–22) is shorter—it only goes from 19 to 22. This
            part is like a strong upward push, driven by that starting energy
            (19), supported briefly (20), balanced a little (21), and then
            finished with a big new start at 22. We call this an "upward
            triangle" because it’s all about moving forward with one strong
            direction, like climbing a hill to reach a new view.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            The Tetragrammaton pattern reveals a universal law of creation where
            three forces interact to produce a fourth, manifest result.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment">
            This recursive structure is evident in nature, human systems, and
            esoteric traditions like the Tarot, reflecting an infinite spiral of
            evolution.
